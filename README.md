PneumoHedoc: Pneumonia Detection Using CNN
PneumoHedoc is a deep learning-based image classification project aimed at detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Built with the Keras Sequential API and powered by TensorFlow, this solution focuses on accurate, scalable, and modular pneumonia diagnosis support.

Key Features
CNN Architecture: Custom Convolutional Neural Network built with Keras Sequential API for binary classification.
Data Preprocessing: Includes image augmentation (rotation, flipping, rescaling) and efficient batch loading using ImageDataGenerator.
Model Training: Trains with support for:
Class weights to handle data imbalance
Validation split
Configurable batch size and epoch settings
Evaluation Metrics: Model performance tracked using accuracy and loss plots.
Modular Codebase: Clean, readable, and well-structured Python modules for training, preprocessing, and inference.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pnemoHedoc.git
cd pnemoHedoc

Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Training
Run the training script after configuring parameters:
python model/train_model.py

The script handles:
Defining the CNN architecture
Compiling with Adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy
Training the model with configurable batch size, learning rate, and data paths
You can modify these hyperparameters directly within train_model.py.


Future Enhancements
Multi-class Classification: Extend model to distinguish between bacterial vs. viral pneumonia
Transfer Learning: Improve accuracy using pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet, or MobileNet
Deployment: Package the model into a Streamlit web app and deploy to platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Cloud
